                During the 1960s, Flagg began writing skits for the New York nightclub Upstairs at the Downstairs.
                When one of the performers got sick, Flagg went on in her place and caught the attention of Candid Camera creator Allen Funt, who happened to be in the audience that night. Soon after, Flagg was invited to be a staff writer on his show and later became a performer as well.
                In 1978, Flagg won first place in fiction for a short story that she had written at the Santa Barbara Writer's Conference.
                The work became the basis for the novel Coming Attractions which was published in 1981 following the deaths of her father and mother.
                The book was reissued in 1992 under the title Flagg originally wanted to use, Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man.
                The autobiographical coming-of-age novel is written as a diary that starts in 1952 with an 11-year-old protagonist, Daisy Fay Harper.
                Daisy uses diary entries to tell the story of her alcoholic father's get-rich-quick schemes and her well-mannered mother.
                The book stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for 10 weeks.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps her best-known novel, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe was published in 1987 and remained on The New York Times bestseller list for 36 weeks.
                It was praised by both Harper Lee and Eudora Welty.
                The novel is told in both past and present tense by the characters Ninny Threadgoode (past) and Evelyn Couch (present) and focuses on the town of Whistle Stop, Alabama, circa the 1920s and 1930s.
                It is about the unlikely bonds forged between women who seemingly have nothing in common except restlessness.
                Flagg subsequently co-wrote the screenplay based on that book, which became the 1991 film Fried Green Tomatoes.
                The movie garnered her a nomination for an Academy Award. Fried Green Tomatoes starred Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker and Cicely Tyson.
                <br><br>
                She has also written Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle-Stop Caf√© Cookbook (1993), Welcome to the World, Baby Girl! (1998), Standing in the Rainbow (2002), A Redbird Christmas (2004), Can't Wait to Get to Heaven (2006), I Still Dream About You (2010), The All-Girl Filling Station's Last Reunion (2013) and The Whole Town's Talking (2016).
                Her latest book, The Wonder Boy of Whistle Stop, was published in October 2020, and includes characters from Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.

                During the 1970s, Flagg was a fixture on game show panels.
                She is best known for her appearances on the game show Match Game (normally occupying the lower right-hand seat next to regular panelist Richard Dawson).
                Her stage acting credits include the short-lived 1978 Broadway play Patio/Porch and the original 1978 Broadway production of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (succeeding Carlin Glynn).
                She appeared in the films Five Easy Pieces (1970), Some of My Best Friends Are... (1971), Stay Hungry (1976), Grease (1978), and Crazy in Alabama (1999).
                <br><br>
                As well as minor roles in various television shows, she appeared as the Amazon Doctor in the 1975 pilot The New Original Wonder Woman with Lynda Carter.
                She is also known for being a regular on The New Dick Van Dyke Show, where for two seasons she played Mike Preston, sister to Van Dyke's character Dick Preston, and for her role as Cassie Bowman in all 30 episodes of the 1980-81 sitcom version of Harper Valley PTA starring Barbara Eden.
                She also appeared several times as a victim of alien abduction on the talk show parody Fernwood 2 Night in 1977. During the 1960s and 1970s, Flagg recorded two comedy albums with various skits that included many parodies of Lady Bird Johnson and Martha Mitchell.
