<h4><a id="head2">Chapter 2<br>Religion</a></h4>
<p align="justify">
    The predominant religion in Oceania is Christianity (73%).
    A 2011 survey found that 92% in Melanesia, 93% in Micronesia and 96% in Polynesia described themselves
    as Christians.
    Traditional religions are often animist, and prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in spirits
    (masalai in Tok Pisin) representing natural forces.
    In the 2018 census, 37% of New Zealanders affiliated themselves with Christianity and 48% declared no
    religion.In the 2016 Census, 52% of the Australian population declared some variety of Christianity and
    30% stated "no religion".
    <br><br>
    In recent Australian and New Zealand censuses, large proportions of the population say they belong to
    "no religion" (which includes atheism, agnosticism, deism, secular humanism).
    In Tonga, everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian
    faith.
    The Ahmadiyya mosque in Marshall Islands is the only mosque in Micronesia.
    Another one in Tuvalu belongs to the same sect. The Baháʼí House of Worship in Tiapapata, Samoa, is one
    of seven designations administered in the Baháʼí Faith.
    <br><br>
    Other religions in the region include Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, which are prominent minority
    religions in Australia and New Zealand.
    Judaism, Sikhism and Jainism are also present.
    Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian-born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish
    vice-regal representative in the British Empire.
    Prince Philip Movement is followed around Yaohnanen village on the southern island of Tanna in Vanuatu.
